    "*\"Everyone can code!\"* is a common phrase used by motivational speakers, to attract people into trying it out. Now, think back to Week 1. How many people were in the room compared to now? A more accurate phrase is probably something like *\"Everyone can code, but not everyone has the time to do it properly.\"*\n",

    "One of the awkward realities that you're going to face is that at some point, another person might have to end up reading it. Putting in effort to make sure your script is easy for others to understand goes a long way, especially when that someone might be you, coming back to something you wrote 3 months ago. The general term for confusing, unclear, or badly written code is ***spaghetti code*** - no prizes for guessing why."

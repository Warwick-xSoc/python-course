    "*\"Everyone can code!\"* is a common phrase used by motivational speakers, to attract people into trying it out. Now, think back to Week 1. How many people were in the room compared to now? A more accurate phrase is probably something like *\"Everyone can code, but not everyone has the time to do it properly.\"*\n",

    "Putting in effort to make sure your script is easy for others to understand goes a long way, especially when that someone might be you, coming back to something you wrote 3 months ago. Confusing, unclear, or badly written code is often called ***spaghetti code*** - no prizes for guessing why!"
